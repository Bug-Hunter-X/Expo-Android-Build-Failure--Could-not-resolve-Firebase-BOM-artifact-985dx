The solution involves ensuring correct Firebase dependency declaration and repository configuration in the `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files.  The following demonstrates a typical correction:

1. **Verify Firebase Package:** Double check the Firebase BOM version in `package.json` and ensure it aligns with the required version. Use `expo install firebase` if you haven't already installed it.
2. **Check Repositories:** In `android/build.gradle`, verify that Google's Maven repository is included:
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google() // Ensure this line is present
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making changes to the `build.gradle` files, run `expo prebuild` then `expo build:android`.
